# Sweet Lift Taxi

Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.

# Project description of the dataset
  * `Num_Orders` — number of orders in a 10-min window
  * `Datatimes` — unique date & time timestamp

# Project Process

## Step 1 | Access & Study the data
* Open and skim to become familiar with the data
## Step 2 | Prepare the data
* Convert the data to the necessary types
* Find & Eliminate errors in the data
## Step 3 | Analyze the data
* Conduct EDA & SDA while exercising the 5 analytic frameworks (if applicable):
  * What happened? - Descriptive 
  * Why did it happen? - Diagnostic 
  * What will happen? - Predictive
  * How can we make it happen? - Prescriptive
## Step 4 | Build a Time Series model 
* Consider and select data that is useful to analyze the information on the taxi orders' trends & patterns that can calibrate to the historical data to predict the future -- by an hour ahead.
## Step 5 | General Conclusion
* State found insights in a clear, concise manner.
